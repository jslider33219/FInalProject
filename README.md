1. PROBLEM STATEMENT
Many players enjoy story-driven horror games but lack the time, hardware, or skill required for large, graphics-heavy titles. Additionally, few games combine psychological horror with meaningful decision-making and resource management in a simple, accessible format.

2. SOLUTION
"Working title"  is a Java-based, text-driven horror game inspired by The Oregon Trail. Players travel from New York to California after a major life change and must manage limited resources while deciding whether to trust a mysterious hitchhiker whose behavior grows increasingly unstable. The MVP focuses on a turn-based journey, psychological decision-making, and multiple endings driven by player choices.

4. TARGET MARKET
Our target users are casual and indie-game players aged 16–35 who enjoy narrative horror, psychological thrillers, and retro or text-based games. This includes fans of interactive fiction, indie horror titles, and story-driven decision games.

5. WHY IT’S VALUABLE
The game delivers a complete horror experience without requiring advanced hardware or long play sessions. Its text-based format allows players to focus on story, tension, and decision-making while remaining highly accessible and replayable.

6. HOW WE’LL MAKE MONEY
The game would be sold as a low-cost one-time purchase ($3–$5) on indie platforms such as itch.io or Steam. Future versions could include paid expansions with additional routes, characters, and endings.

7. MVP FEATURES
Turn-based road-trip progression across multiple U.S. regions
Resource management system (gas, food, water, sanity)
Inventory system with usable items that affect player stats
Narrative events and dialogue choices that influence outcomes
Multiple endings based on player decisions and sanity level
